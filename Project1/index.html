        <p class="aboutive">About Ive</p>
        <p class="article">Ive is a South Korean girl group formed by Starship Entertainment. The group is composed of six members: Yujin, Gaeul, Rei, Wonyoung, Liz and
        Leeseo. They made their debut on December 1, 2021, with the single album Eleven.The group's name, Ive, is a contraction for "I have". It alludes to the idea of confidently 
        showing what "I have" to the audience. Instead of telling the story of a growing girl group, Ive will try to portray a "complete girl group" from the start.On April 5,
         Ive released their second single album, Love Dive, led by the single of the same name. </p>
